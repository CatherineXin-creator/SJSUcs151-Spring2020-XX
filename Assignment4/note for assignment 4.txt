Professor, I checked my code and I realized I used Address class to store the shipping address for customer and I did not implement this class anywhere except using it in the main method. Although we discussed this question and you showed me to use the address as an attribute for a person, and I think I understand what you said, it was hard to apply it to my existing code and I tried 2 times, it resulted to rewrite the code. So I just show address class individually in the class diagram
